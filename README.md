# Decentralized MultiSig Wallet

## What is a MultiSig Wallet?
A Multi-Signature (MultiSig) wallet is like a digital safe that requires multiple people to agree before any money can be spent. Think of it as a bank vault that needs multiple keys to open, making it more secure than a wallet that only needs one person's approval.

## Why Use This?
- **Extra Security**: Even if one owner's account is compromised, funds remain safe
- **Group Control**: Perfect for managing company funds or group savings
- **Transparency**: All transaction attempts are visible to all owners
- **Trust Minimization**: No single person can run away with the funds

## Features Explained
1. **Multiple Owners**
   - Like having multiple bank account signatories
   - Each owner has equal rights to propose and confirm transactions

2. **Transaction Confirmation**
   - When someone wants to send money, others must approve
   - Example: If there are 3 owners, 2 might need to approve before money moves

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - See transaction requests instantly
   - Track who has confirmed what
   - Monitor wallet balance in real-time
